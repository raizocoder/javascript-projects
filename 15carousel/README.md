### HTML Structure

The carousel structure is very simple. Each image is wrapped in a container, and there are navigation buttons to slide through the images.

```html
<div class="carousel-container">
    <div class="carousel">
        <img class="carousel-slide" src="image1.jpg" alt="Slide 1">
        <img class="carousel-slide" src="image2.jpg" alt="Slide 2">
        <img class="carousel-slide" src="image3.jpg" alt="Slide 3">
    </div>
    <button class="prev" onclick="moveSlide(-1)">&#10094;</button>
    <button class="next" onclick="moveSlide(1)">&#10095;</button>
</div>
```

### Customization

You can easily customize the carousel by:

- Replacing the placeholder images with your own.
- Adjusting the width or height of the carousel by modifying the CSS file.
- Adding more slides by inserting additional `img` elements inside the `.carousel` div.

### JavaScript Logic

The JavaScript file contains simple logic to handle slide transitions. Feel free to modify or extend the code to add features like autoplay or swipe gestures.
