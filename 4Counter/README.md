# 🕒 Counter App
# DEMO -- https://counter-rohit.netlify.app/

The **Counter App** is a simple web application that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value. It's a straightforward example of JavaScript functionality for basic user interactions.

## 🚀 Features

- **➕ Increment**: Increase the counter value by 1.
- **➖ Decrement**: Decrease the counter value by 1, with a minimum value of 0.
- **🔄 Reset**: Set the counter value back to 0.
- **🎨 Simple Design**: Clean and user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## 📋 How to Use

1. **Open the Webpage**: Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. **Interact with the Counter**:
   - **Click the "+" button** to increase the counter value.
   - **Click the "-" button** to decrease the counter value.
   - **Click the "Reset" button** to reset the counter to 0.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
📁 Counter-App/
├── 📄 index.html
├── 📄 style.css
└── 📄 main.js
```

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the counter app.
- **style.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the layout and design of the counter app.
- **main.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for handling the counter functionality.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface with clear and intuitive buttons.
- **Interactive**: Provides immediate feedback with every button click.
- **Basic Functionality**: Great example for learning how to manipulate DOM elements with JavaScript.

## 🤖 How it Works

1. **JavaScript Functions**:
   - `plusValue()`: Increments the counter value and updates the input field.
   - `minusValue()`: Decrements the counter value and ensures it doesn't go below 0.
   - `resetValue()`: Resets the counter value to 0 and updates the input field.

2. **HTML Structure**: 
   - An `<input>` field displays the current counter value.
   - Three `<button>` elements allow the user to increase, decrease, or reset the counter.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- 🌈 **Add Styles**: Enhance the design with additional CSS styles for a more appealing look.
- 🧮 **Customizable Step**: Allow users to set custom increment/decrement values.
- 📈 **Save State**: Implement localStorage to remember the counter value between page reloads.
